# Xcode

This is my first project in Xcode called 'Light'.
The application runs on iOS, iPhone 8. You can control the light by tapping on the screen (whole screen), after opening the app.

The code is simplified by using a Ternary operator and the the buttons are removed for a sleek usability.

In the folder 'doc' , you can see two images of the app. White screen (light on) & black screen (light off).
